You're a senior UX designer and product strategist working on a privacy-first, AI-powered SaaS platform called Encompass The platform is used by solo and small firms in eyesore.

Design a clean, modern, and intuitive multi-platform UI/UX for the following key user flow:

**Use Case:** A professional eyecare office wants to onboard a new client, collect intake forms securely, initiate AI-assisted triage, and communicate via secure SMS or voice.

**Requirements:**
- Mobile-first but fully responsive for desktop
- Compliant with HIPAA and legal data privacy standards
- Simple and low-friction UX for busy professionals
- Include accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) considerations
- Smart AI assistant should feel integrated but non-intrusive
- Use Angular for UI

**Deliverables:**
1. A high-level user journey map (client and pro perspectives)
2. Wireframe breakdowns for 3 screens:
    - Client Onboarding & Intake
    - AI Triage & Summary Review
    - Communication Hub (SMS/voice/email interface)
3. Recommended UI layout patterns and visual style
4. Suggested microcopy for buttons, error messages, and tooltips
5. Technical considerations for design handoff (e.g. Figma components, dev-ready code stubs)

Focus on:
- Reducing cognitive load
- Personalization using AI
- Trust-building elements in the UI (e.g., badge, secure icons, simple language)

## VBD Architecture Guidelines

**MANDATORY:** All new development must follow VBD (Value-Based Development) principles with strict separation of concerns:

### 1. ACCESSORS (`/src/lib/accessors/`)
- **Purpose**: Pure data access layer, database-agnostic
- **Rules**: 
  - NO business logic, only CRUD operations
  - Must extend BaseAccessor interface
  - Return consistent result types with error handling
  - Include proper TypeScript typing for all operations
- **Example**: `ClientAccessor.getById(id)`, `UserAccessor.create(data)`

### 2. ENGINES (`/src/lib/engines/`)
- **Purpose**: Business logic and domain rules
- **Rules**:
  - Use accessors for all data operations
  - Stateless functions only
  - No direct database access
  - Single responsibility per engine
- **Example**: `TriageEngine.analyzeIntake()`, `AuthEngine.validateCredentials()`

### 3. MANAGERS (`/src/lib/managers/`)
- **Purpose**: Workflow orchestration across engines
- **Rules**:
  - Coordinate multiple engines
  - Handle complex business workflows
  - Manage transactions
  - API route coordination
- **Example**: `ClientManager.onboardClient()`, `IntakeManager.processSubmission()`

### Implementation Order:
1. Create BaseAccessor interface first
2. Implement specific accessors
3. Build engines using accessors
4. Create managers using engines
5. Refactor API routes to use managers

**CRITICAL**: Never bypass this architecture. All data access must go through accessors.

## Code Quality & Testing Standards

**MANDATORY:** Maintain 90% automated testing coverage across the codebase before adding new features.

### Testing Requirements:
- **Unit Tests**: All accessors, engines, and managers must have comprehensive unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: API routes and database interactions must be tested
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript interfaces and types must be properly defined
- **Error Handling**: All error paths must be tested and documented
- **Performance Tests**: Database queries and API endpoints must meet performance benchmarks

### Code Quality Standards:
- Zero TypeScript errors in production code
- Consistent error handling patterns across all components
- Proper logging and monitoring instrumentation
- Documentation for all public APIs and complex business logic
- Security validation for all user inputs and data access
